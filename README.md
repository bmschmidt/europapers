Hastily written code--I'm sure these notebooks don't run end to end--uploaded just to share with the bigscience LAM group.

One note is that I have a not-included file called 'api_key.py' for import. It just looks like this:

```
api_key = 'my_secret_key'
```

Not sure what it's for--metadata, I think?
